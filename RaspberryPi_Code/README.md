This folder contains Python code for the Raspberry Pi heartbeat simulation.
This Python script simulates ECG-like heartbeats and sends the signal data to the Arduino Uno via serial communication. It also plots the waveform in real-time using Matplotlib for visual reference.

Key Features:

Sends simulated heart rate data

Visualizes ECG waveform

Regulates heart rate to 60 BPM (threshold)

Interfaces with Arduino over USB (Serial)
